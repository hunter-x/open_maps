# open_maps
### project description
All over the world, biologists draw full benefit from their raw data by performing data analysis especially creating maps.
Biology research groups in low income countries suffer from budget restrictions due to several economical and political issues. They are facing difficulties to purchase licenses for non academic GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software and lack financial support to benefit from trainings abroad. 
Non free as well as free GIS softwares are already available offering a large sets of options. However, multiple training sessions are required to master these tools.
###
The aim of this initiative, is to offer a minimal alternative to these softwares. Our project will be accessible to GIS and non GIS users. The application is destined to be used mainly by biologists with no prior programming experience. It will allow the targeted users to spend more time on curating and analyzing their data rather than setting up complex environments, fetching appropriate map format, converting their data accordingly and debugging.   
Specifically we aim to develop a tool which allows the interactive visualization of epidemiological data projected on 2D maps using freeware and public packages. The tool will be preferentially  developed using Python programming language. Users will be able to upload their raw data files containing spatio-temporal measurements and explore them interactively. They will also be able to generate graphics and reports on a “what you see is what you get” basics.
