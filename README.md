# open_maps
### project description
Scientists draw full benefit from their raw data by performing complex data analysis. Creating maps is an essential component to associate meaningful interpretation to data.
Research groups in low income countries suffer from budget restrictions due to several economical and political issues and can't afford purchasing licenses for non academic GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software neither following specific GIS softaware trainings.  
Free GIS softwares are available and offer a large set of options. However, their use is not trivial and require intensive training sessions.
###
The aim of this project, is to offer an alternative to these softwares. Our project will be accessible to GIS and non GIS users. The application is destined to be used mainly by biologists with no prior programming experience. It will allow the targeted users to spend more time on curating and analyzing their data rather than setting up complex environments, fetching appropriate map format, converting their data accordingly and debugging.   
Specifically we aim to develop a tool which allows the interactive visualization of epidemiological data projected on 2D maps using freeware and public packages. The tool will be preferentially  developed using Python programming language. Users will be able to upload their raw data files containing spatio-temporal measurements and explore them interactively. They will also be able to generate graphics and reports on a “what you see is what you get” basics.
