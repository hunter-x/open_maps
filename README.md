# open_maps
### project description
Scientists draw full benefit from their raw data by performing complex data analysis. Creating maps is an essential component to associate meaningful interpretation to data.
Research groups in low income countries suffer from budget restrictions due to several economical and political issues and can't afford purchasing licenses for non academic GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software neither following specific GIS softaware trainings.  
Open license GIS softwares are available and offer a large set of options. However, their use is not trivial and require intensive training sessions.
###
The aim of this project, is to offer an open, user friendly alternative to these tools and will be accessible to GIS and non GIS users and its use won't require any programming experience. It will allow the targeted users to spend more time on curating and analyzing their data rather than setting up complex environments, fetching appropriate map format, converting their data accordingly and debugging.   

Open maps will offer interactive visualization of scientific data projected on 2D maps. It will be developped based on the use of open packages such as Python libraries.
Users will be able to upload their raw data files containing spatio-temporal measurements, explore them interactively and generate graphics and reports on a “what you see is what you get” basics.
