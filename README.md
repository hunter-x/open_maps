# open_maps
### project description
Non free GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software are already available offering a large sets of options. Biology research groups in low income countries suffer from budget restrictions due to several economical and political issues. They are unable to purchase licenses for non academic GIS software. Also, several free editions of GIS softwares are available online. However, their usage requires a trained personnel.

Our application will be accessible to non GIS users
 The aim of this initiative, is to offer a minimal alternative to these softwares. Our project will be accessible to non GIS users. The application is destined to be used mainly by biologists with little or no prior programming experience. It will allow to the targeted users to spend more time on curating and analyzing their data rather than setting up complex environments, fetching appropriate map format, converting their data accordingly and debugging.   
Specifically we aim to develop of a tool which allows the interactive visualization of epidemiological data projected on 2D maps using freeware and public packages. The tool will be preferentially  developed using Python programming language. Users will be able to upload their raw data files containing spatio-temporal measurements and explore them interactively. They will also be able to generate graphics and reports on a “what you see is what you get” basics.
